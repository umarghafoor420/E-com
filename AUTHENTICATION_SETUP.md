# Authentication Setup Guide

## Clerk Configuration

To complete the authentication setup, you need to configure Clerk with your environment variables:

### 1. Create Environment File
Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with the following variables:

```env
# Clerk Authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_publishable_key_here
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here

# Clerk URLs (optional - defaults work for most cases)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/

# Currency (optional)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CURRENCY=$
```

### 2. Get Clerk Keys
1. Go to [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com)
2. Create a new application or select existing one
3. Go to "API Keys" section
4. Copy your Publishable Key and Secret Key
5. Paste them into your `.env.local` file
